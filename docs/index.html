<h1 id="bermuda-covid-19-dashboard">Bermuda COVID-19 “Dashboard”</h1>
<h2 id="key-statistics">Key statistics</h2>
<p><strong>3</strong> cases per 100,000 people in the week 21-Jun-21 - 27-Jun-21.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> cases in the week 21-Jun-21 - 27-Jun-21.</p>
<p><strong>-7</strong> compared with the previous week.</p>
<p><strong>1221</strong> total cases in 2021.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>The daily press-releases and conferences are great and frustrating all at the same time. They provide useful metrics but not the same numbers as are reported by the likes of the BBC which make comparing the situation in Bermuda to other countries more difficult. This site is an attempt to solve that problem.</p>

<p>On May 12, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) advised governments that before reopening, rates of positivity in testing (ie, out of all tests conducted, how many came back positive for COVID-19) of should remain at 5% or lower for at least 14 days. The vertical red line on this chart represents 14 days ago from today.</p>
