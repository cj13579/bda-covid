## Development

This is a project written in Python and has two main files:

* `dlPages.py` - Downloads data from [gov.bm](https://gov.bm).
* `app.py` - Parses the data, calculates stats, creates CSV files

To get started with the project after cloning the repository:

1. Create a venv: `python -m venv env`
2. Activate venv: `. env/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

There is also a notebook for getting started.
